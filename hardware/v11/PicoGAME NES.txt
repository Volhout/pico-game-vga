PicoGAME NES

The PicoGAME (NES version) is simply a PCB which allows NES controllers or a PC joystick to be connected to a PicoMite VGA. The usual PicoMite VGA facilities are available:
 16-colour VGA display
 PS/2 keyboard input
 Stereo sound output


The PCB has been arranged to have two DB9F sockets on the front, together with a Power On / Mode LED. Port A socket can accept a NES controller and can also be used for serial port networking. Additionally it has a single analogue input. Port B socket can accept either a NES controller or a PC-type switched or analogue joystick.Switching between these modes is done in software and the current mode is indicated by the LED: red for NES, green for PC mode.

The Audio output has a link for each channel to allow it to be at either high or low level. Low level is suitable for line output to an external amplifier. High level should be used with headphones of 32R or greater impedance.


The GPIO pins have been connected as follows:

DB9F Port A
Pin		NES mode	PC mode		Auxiliary mode
1	No connection
2	GP0	Data		-		COM1 TX
3	GP1	Latch		-		COM1 RX
4	GP2	Clock		-		Spare
5	No connection
6		3V3		3V3		3V3
7		3V3		3V3		3V3	
8		GND		GND		GND
9	GP28	Spare		Paddle A	Spare

DB9F Port B
Pin		NES mode	PC mode		Auxiliary mode
1	GP3	Spare		Up
2	GP4	Data		Down
3	GP5	Latch		Left
4	GP22	Clock		Right
5	GP26	Spare		Paddle B
6		(3V3)		Trigger (GP14)
7		3V3		3V3
8		GND		GND
9	GP27	Spare		Paddle A

Port B is normally in NES mode. Pin 6 is switched into PC mode by raising GP15 high.
The ADC pins GP26, GP27 & GP28 have 10k rsistors which can be selected as pull-up, pull-down or disconnected. All other pins have 10k pull-up resistors(GP1 has a higher value).
GP0 also has a series resistor to protect against short circuits when used as COM1 TX.
GP1 also has a series resistor and clamping diodes to protect against harmful voltages when used as COM1 RX.

When the ADC inputs are used for Paddle inputs in PC mode (i.e. 100k variable resistor to 3V3) the jumpers must be set in the DN position. If they are to be used with potentiometers from 0-3V3 then they should be disconnected. If used as digital inputs the jumpers can be set in the UP position if required.
